## Introduction

In this project, you will have to use an API to get your data from the web. 
By the end of it, you will have done projects with flat files, databases, scraping and API: enough to show that you know enough to kickstart data analysis with any kind of data sources.

The API used in this project is the ["The Movie DB"](https://www.themoviedb.org). 
Unlike the APIs we used in the units, this one will ask you to create an account and use a `key` in all your queries (i.e. inside the URL). 
This is much closer to a real-life scenario as most serious APIs use this kind of authentication system.

## Getting access to "The Movie DB"

First, you will need to create an account. 
You can use your `@extensionschool.com` email for this.

You will probably be asked to verify your account (i.e. click on a link sent to your email and reenter your username and password).

Once this is done, you will have an account on "The Movie DB", but that is not enough to use the API. 
We now need to create an "API application" in the account (i.e. a project).

Creating an "application" is a common API pattern, lots of API providers (including Google and Twitter) ask you to do such thing. 
This is a way for them to see if you will use their data for commercial purpose (and charge you if so). 
You can see which commercial products already use "The Movie DB" [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/apps).  

Go to the settings of your account by clicking on the little initial logo on the top right hand side and click **"Settings"**.


![](https://d7whxh71cqykp.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/data/2244/04-project-movie-setup1.png)

In your **"Settings"** page, click on **"API"** in the left hand side menu (➊), then **"Create"** (➋) and choose **"Developer"** (➌), since you are an individual and developing a not for profit project.

After you accept the "Terms and Conditions", you will be asked for some information. 
If you do not want to give out your personal details, please use the Extension School ones (as we checked with "The Movie DB" that this course was fair use):

![](https://d7whxh71cqykp.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/data/2247/04-project-movie-setup3.png)

- **Type of Use:** Education (from the drop down menu)
- **Application name:** your EXTS username (or anything else)
- **First Name:** First two letters of your username
- **Last Name:** Last two letters of your username
- **Application URL:** Since we do not plan to really use the data in a web application, you can simply write `"localhost.com"` for the URL (it means that this application will only live in your computer).
- **Application Summary**: Course project for EPFL EXTS
- **Email Address:** This should be filled automatically with the email you provided for your account
- **Phone Number:** 0216935041
- **Address1:** EPFL Extension School
- **Address2:** EPFL Innovation Park, Building E
- **Zip Code:** 1015
- **City:** Lausanne
- **State:** Vaud
- **Country:** Switzerland

If all went well, you should now have an API `Key` in your "Settings" page. 
Congratulations, you just created a *real* account on a *real* professional API!

![](https://d7whxh71cqykp.cloudfront.net/uploads/image/data/2246/04-project-movie-setup4.png)

The key you received for your project is a random string of letters and numbers (➊). 
You will have to use it in the URLs when you query the API: it is like your login/password to the service when you use the API.

So to get the data from the movie with `ID` `550`, you cannot just send a `GET` request to this address:

```
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550
```

Instead you have to add an `api_key=` parameter at the end of all the urls you use (using your personal key number—the one below is fake):

```
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/550?api_key=f193f4e58300
```

Like often with well-documented APIs, you can find a page listing a  [bunch of example queries](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover) to help you understand what is possible.

## Exercises
### Part 1

Try to send a `GET` request to [some of the example queries](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover) and inspect the result. 
Inspired just by these examples, how would create new requests:

- What are the highest grossing dramas from 2010?
- Have Will Ferrell and Liam Neeson even been in a movie together?
- Can you find kids movies with Tom Cruise in it?

### Part 2

As you can see in the examples, there are two types of parameters used in the URLs:

- parameters that take an "explicit" value, like `primary_release_year=` or `sort_by=`. When you read their values (e.g. `2014` or `popularity.desc`), you know straight away what is queried.
- parameters that take an "id" value, like `with_cast=` or `with_genres=`. When you read their values (e.g. `23659` or `878`), you don't really know what is queried if you don't know what id means what.

This is common as well with APIs. Parameters that might have complicated/long/confusing spelling (like the title of a movie or the full name of an actor) often use ID. 
What if two movies or two actors have the same name? 
That's also a situation where IDs would help.

The problem is that you need to find these ids before sending the query that you are really interested in. 
And to do that you need to prepare another query. 
This is when you start reading [the full API documentation](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

In this case, you would want to check the [`Search` endpoints](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/search/search-companies). 

The `Search` endpoints let you search by name and find the id for different kinds of resources  (companies, people, movie title...). 
If you are unsure on how to write these URLs, there is a helpful tab "Try it out" that lets you experiment with the URLs.

From `RStudio`, what query would you make to find the id of the animation movies company "Pixar"? 
Show both the query and how you extract the id from the result in your report.

### Part 3

Now that we have the id of Pixar, we should be able to find all the movies that they have worked on. 
But you don't know how do a search for movies by companies...

Go read the documentation for the [`/discover/movies` endpoint](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie-discover). 
You will see the full list of parameters that you can use for filtering your results. 
Some will be familiar since they were used in the examples (e.g. `with_cast=`, `primary_release_year=` or `with_genre=`). 
Other will be new (e.g. `with_runtime.lte=` that lets you select just the movies that are shorter than a certain time).

Write a query that will give you all the Pixar movies and sort them by descending revenue. 
The result will be given to you as a JSON (parsed to a `list` by `{httr}`).
Convert this list to a `tibble` so you have one row per film and one column per interesting piece of information.

Also have a close look at the keys in your `list`. 
You will notice that the API sends **"paginated" results** (i.e. look at these `page` and `total_pages` keys). 
It means that you never get more than `x` results at a time (at the time of this writing, this API sends `20` results at a time).
Paginated APIs are **extremely** common as administrators don't want users to send queries that would require a ton of data and block the service for others for a long time.

If you want to get the other pages, you need to play with the `page` parameter in your url.
Further, consider that if you want to repeat the same query over and over for different pages, `purrr::map()` is a useful function.

### Part 4

You may know that Pixar was acquired by Disney in 2006, after they had already been collaborating on films for more than a decade. 
For the last part of the report, we are going to look into whether this was a smart strategic decision by Disney, by comparing the popularity of both Disney and Pixar films that came out from 2006 onwards.

- First, acquire the "id" for Disney using the `search` endpoint. Note that if you try to find the company ID for Disney, there will be more than one result (Disney has many subsidiaries with the name "Disney" in it). For this exercise, specifically look for "Walt Disney Pictures" in the USA.
- Second, get the vote averages and vote counts for films from Walt Disney Productions and from Pixar using the `discover/movies` endpoint. Use the API documentation to find out how to get films from 2006 *onwards*.
- Now, compare the vote averages using boxplots and a t-test, with the aim of answering the question *Are the films from Pixar on average more popular than the films from Walt Disney Pictures?*

A suggestion here would be to filter the data by including only films with a `vote_count` of at least 50.
Consider that if only a few people voted on the film, the vote average will not be as representative as when lots of people have voted on the film.
